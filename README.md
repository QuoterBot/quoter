	Quoter is a Discord bot that allows you to save messages into a quote book,
	and share them with your friends. Add, edit, and delete quotes, then view
	them from a list, get one randomly, or even turn them into images.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to use Quoter is with the official hosted version. You can add it to your server at [quoter.cc/invite](https://quoter.cc/invite).

If you want to host your own version, you can follow the instructions below.

## üõ†Ô∏è Self-Hosting (advanced)

While we support self-hosting, we do not provide any support for it. If you are not familiar with the technologies used, we recommend using the hosted version above.

To run Quoter, you will need the following:

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh) (we target the latest 1.x release)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (we target the latest 7.x release)

You'll also need to create a Discord bot and invite it to your server. Head to [Discord's developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Create a bot user, and get the token. You'll need to invite the bot to your server using the following link, replacing `REPLACE_ME` with your bot's client ID:

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=REPLACE_ME
```

Start off by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quoter/quoter.git
cd quoter
bun install
```

Then, copy `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` and fill in the values:

-   `DISCORD_TOKEN` is the token of your Discord bot.
-   `MONGO_URI` is the URI to your MongoDB database.

You can also adjust the default `MAX_GUILD_QUOTES` and `MAX_QUOTE_LENGTH`.

Run the below command to deploy Slash Commands to Discord.

```bash
bun run deploy
```

Finally, run the bot:

```bash
bun run start
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quoter! Before you get started, please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you're developing a new feature, or making significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss it with us.

Quoter is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as a runtime and package manager. MongoDB is used for data storage. We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to enforce code style.

To get started, follow the self-hosting guide above, but clone your fork instead of the main repository. You'll also want to configure the `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` environment variable to point to your test server, which is where Slash Commands will be deployed in development. Use `bun run deploy --guild` to deploy with guild-specific commands, instead of global commands.

Before submitting a pull request, please run `bun run lint` to ensure your code is formatted correctly.
