## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Quoter! Before making any changes, [open an issue](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter/issues) to make sure they're needed. Follow the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!

### Setup

**Hosting Quoter yourself is not supported.** The recommended way to use the bot is through the [official, public instance](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=784853298271748136&permissions=19456&scope=bot%20applications.commands). These instructions are meant for contributors.

-   Quoter requires **Node.js `v16.8.0`** and **mongoDB `v3.0.0` or higher**.

1. Run `npm install` to install Quoter's dependencies.
2. Copy `config.json.EXAMPLE` to `config.json` & change as necessary.
    - You'll probably want to add your bot's `token`, and add your own user Id to the `admins` array.
3. Run `node deployCommands.js <client Id> [guild Id]` to register slash commands.
    - Replace `<client Id>` with your bot's Id & replace `[guild Id]` with your development guild.
    - When deploying to production, omit `[guild Id]` to create global slash commands, rather than guild ones.
4. Run the bot with `node .`!

Before committing any changes, run `npm run lint:fix` to run ESLint & Prettier. Address any issues ESLint has.
